# REFLEXArduinoCode
 REFLEX is a camera startup, with the aim of creating a modular camera. 
 
 This set of code was used to program the Arduino (BLE Nano) controller. The Arduino BLE Nano was used to run the camera's feature using either BLE (via UART*) or UART to send commands.
 
* The Arduino BLE Nano has a mode where it transmits all serial (UART)
 data via BLE.
